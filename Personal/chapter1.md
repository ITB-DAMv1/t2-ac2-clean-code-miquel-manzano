# Chapter One: Clean Code
This book will teach us how to be better programmers and know how to transform bad code into good code.

## There Will Be Code
"Code is imortal", at least that is what this chapter wants to convey to us.

> We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.

In conclusion, it doesn't matter how the level of abstraction of our languages will increase, we will continue to need code.


## Bad Code
Having a mess in your code can make your app go fell into disuse, or bring the company down, that's Bad Code.
It's normal to have a bad code when we are in a rush or have a deadline, but it is our duty to make an effort and have a Good Code instead of a Bad Code working god knows how.

> Have you ever been significantly impeded by bad code? If you are a programmer of any experience then you’ve felt this impediment many times. Indeed, we have a name for it. We call it wading.


## The Total Cost of Owning a Mess
Messy code can slow down a project a little bit too much. If we don't care about Good Code, the more time we spend working, the more messy it will be, and productivity will decrease.

> Every change they make to the code breaks two or three other parts of the code. No change is trivial. Every addition or modification to the system requires that the tangles, twists, and knots be “understood” so that more tangles, twists, and knots can be added. Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep and so tall, they can not clean it up. There is no way at all.

### The Grand Redesign in the Sky
When a code base is already so messy that it is very difficult to continue developing the program, the team demands a redesign. That means a new team is redesigning the program from scratch in a race with the old one. Until the new program does the same things as the old one, it won't be updated. It takes a long time to redesign a program.

> A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it’s a green- field project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.

That's why keeping your code clean is not just cost-effective; it’s a matter of professional survival.

### Attitude
Having a Bad Code is our fault, it's unprofessional. Managers may impose schedules or requirements on us, but it is our duty to defend our code with passion, just as they do with their schedules.

> Most managers want the truth, even when they don’t act like it. Most managers want good code, even when they are obsessing about the schedule. They may defend the schedule and requirements with passion; but that’s their job. It’s your job to defend the code with equal passion.

*So too it is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don’t understand the risks of making messes.*

### The Primal Conundrum
The extract from the book explains itself so well that I will leave it like that:

> Programmers face a conundrum of basic values. All developers with more than a few years experience know that previous messes slow them down. And yet all developers feel the pressure to make messes in order to meet deadlines. In short, they don’t take the time to go fast! True professionals know that the second part of the conundrum is wrong. You will not make the deadline by making the mess. Indeed, the mess will slow you down instantly, and will force you to miss the deadline. The only way to make the deadline—the only way to go fast—is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times.

### The Art of Clean Code?
Writing Clean Code requires "code-sense", some people have this skill by default, but others need to work hard to acquire it. "code-sense" means that you can look at a messy code and know what's wrong and think about variations and how to fix it.

> In short, a programmer who writes clean code is an artist who can take a blank screen through a series of transformations until it is an elegantly coded system.

### What Is Clean Code?
Here, the author talks with some famous programmers about her opinion on what's Clean Code, I will leave here my favorite one:

> I could list all of the qualities that I notice in clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them. Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements, you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone left for you—code left by some- one who cares deeply about the craft.

This is my favorite because I love the idea of someone loving what they are doing and putting all their efforts into making it as clean as they possibly can. Care about your code is beautiful.


## Schools of Thought
This book is like a teacher-student relationship; you learn the basics from the teacher, but there are lots of ways to do the same thing. Sometimes you disagree with the teacher and do it differently; that's alright. This book only teaches you the experience of decades of the authors, it is in your power to use them or not.
